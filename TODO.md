- Make loading a bit more resilient. It seems possible that a user could kill the app while it's saving enchants to disk and corrupt the cached enchants, resulting in failed loading.
- Add enchant verification to OCR
- Add version to sys tray menu
- Add services support
- Add price checking
- Use gzip for enchants
- Default position for settings / errors should not be top right (maybe on top of search window?)
